      On November 4th, Litvinenko was admitted to Barnet General Hospital in north London. He used an alias to hide his
      identity and presented to the hospital with acute abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting. The hospital decided to
      admit him because of his dehydration and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms. The doctors initially diagnosed him
      with gastroenteritis and treated him with antibiotics. Later, Clostridium difficile was detected in his stool. At
      that point, he first raised the possibility of being poisoned and revealed his true identity.

    <p class="article-text">
      Within the first six days, his platelet and white blood cell levels were catastrophically low (thrombocytopenia
      and neutropenia) and he was transferred to University College Hospital. In addition, his bone marrow samples were
      acellular, meaning very few blood-forming (haematopoietic) cells were present, often replaced by fat. This
      condition is known as bone marrow aplasia and is probably the cause of his low platelet and white blood cell
      levels. Very low platelet and white blood cell levels combined with acellular bone marrow is a sign of destroyed
      stem cells. Destroyed stem cells are often caused by radiation poisoning. After two weeks, he developed alopecia
      (hair loss) and mucositis (inflammation of mucous membranes in the digestive tract).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      Around this time, urine samples from heavy metals screening showed a marginally elevated concentration of
      thallium. As a result, thallium poisoning was suspected and widely reported in the media from November 19th. This
      was later dismissed because his thallium levels were below toxic thresholds. On November 4th, he was moved to
      intensive care due to his worsening condition. Around this time, the first suspicions of Russian involvement in
      his poisoning appeared but the Kremlin dismissed the allegations.

    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      As a last resort, his blood and urine samples were sent to a nuclear research site to test for radioactive
      substances. At first, the scientists could not identify anything indicating radiological poisoning apart from a
      small spike at 0,803 mega electron volts (MeV). One of the scientists, who had worked on an early atomic bomb
      programme, identified this as the typical small gamma ray signal emitted by polonium-210.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      The hospital was notified of the probable polonium-210 poisoning on November 22nd but there was little they could
      do. On November 23rd, the result was confirmed. On the same day, Litvinenko died from cardiorespiratory arrest.
