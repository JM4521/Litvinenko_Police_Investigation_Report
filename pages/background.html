    <p class="article-text">Alexander Litvinenko was born on August 30th, 1962, in Voronezh (Russia) and died in London
      on November 23rd, 2006. He was part of the KGB from 1986 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. After
      that, he joined the newly established FSB.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      In 1998, Litvinenko was part of a press conference with several of his colleagues for a television channel. In the
      press conference, they accused senior FSB officials of instructing them to assassinate Russian business oligarch
      Boris Berezovsky and other prominent Russian politicians and businesspeople. Out of all of his colleagues, he was
      the only person to reveal his identity. Everyone else wore masks. He was dismissed from the FSB the same year and
      became a target of state persecution, mostly because of this press conference. The press conference was never
      aired in its entirety. In total, he spent twelve years working for the KGB and FSB.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      Two years later, he decided to leave for the United Kingdom together with his family to escape persecution in
      Russia. In the UK, he received political asylum and settled in London. He began working as a journalist, writer
      and consultant for the British intelligence services in 2003.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      In London, Litvinenko wrote two books: <cite>Blowing Up Russia: Terror from Within</cite> and <cite>Lubyanka Criminal Group</cite>. 
      In <cite>Blowing Up Russia: Terror from Within</cite>, he accused the FSB of having staged the 1999 Russian apartment bombings to
      help bring Putin to power. In <cite>Lubyanka Criminal Group</cite>, he accused the authorities of engaging in
      organised crime. Both of these books significantly escalated tensions between him and the Russian government.
