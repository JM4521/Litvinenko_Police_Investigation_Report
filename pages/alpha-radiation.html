      Alpha radiation is an ionising form of radiation, carrying between 4 and 9 mega electron volts (MeV) with each
      particle. An alpha particle is composed of 2 neutrons and 2 protons, resembling a helium nucleus that has been
      stripped of its electrons. Alpha particles are created by being emitted from the nucleus of a heavy radioactive
      element, such as uranium, radium and polonium, through a process called alpha decay. They are very energetic and
      have a positive charge (+2).

    <p class="article-text">
      Alpha particles are highly ionising, but this also contributes to their weak penetration ability. They cannot even
      pass through a sheet of paper or human skin, so it is not dangerous to humans, unless ingested. If alpha radiation
      enters the human body, however, it causes usually significant internal damage and often death, even from very
      small doses.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      In comparison, other forms of radiation such as gamma and beta radiation have greater penetration power, however
      they are not quite as dangerous if ingested. Both gamma and beta radiation can pass through the skin into the
      human body. Thick layers of lead, concrete or tungsten are needed to stop gamma rays.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      Alpha radiation is infamously difficult to detect once inside the body. Alpha particles, unlike gamma rays, can
      not escape the body, meaning that conventional radiation monitoring techniques cannot detect internal alpha
      contamination. This contributed to the delayed diagnosis in the case of Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned
      using polonium-210, an alpha radiation emitter.

    <h2>Quiz</h2>
    <div class="question">
      <div>Why can an alpha particle be called a helium ion?</div>
      <button class="button" id="button1" type="button" onclick="answerFunction('answer1')">See answer</button>
      <br><br>
      <p class="answer" id="answer1">When an atom loses or gains an electron, it becomes an ion. Alpha particles are
        identical to a helium nucleus (a helium atom without its electrons).</p>

    <div class="question">
      <div>Why is alpha radiation the least and most dangerous type of radiation?</div>
      <button class="button" id="button2" type="button" onclick=answerFunction("answer2")>See
        answer</button>
      <br><br>
      <p class="answer" id="answer2">Alpha radiation is the most dangerous because it carries high energy, but it is the
        least dangerous externally because it has difficulty reaching areas where that energy can cause harm.</p>
