      On the 1st of November, Litvinenko met Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi at the bar of a London hotel, where he
      drank tea containing polonium. Forensic evidence from the police investigation shows that the bar was heavily
      contaminated with polonium. The highest readings were taken at their table and inside one of the teapots.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      Later that same day, he met Mario Scaramella (an Italian KGB and FSB expert) at a sushi bar in central London and
      received documents about the death of Anna Politkovskaya (a Russian investigative journalist). Several hours
      later, he fell ill and spent the night vomiting.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      Following Litvinenko’s death on November 23rd, police began a murder investigation and discovered the trail of
      polonium that had been left all across London. By following this trail, the police identified Andrei Lugovoi and
      Dmitry Kovtun as the prime suspects. Both of them travelled between Moscow and London during the time in question,
      left significant traces of polonium in multiple locations they visited and met multiple times with Litvinenko
      before he died.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      Polonium-210 is a very dangerous and difficult-to-obtain substance. This raises the possibility of
      government-level involvement. However, Lugovoi, Kovtun and the Russian government strongly deny their involvement,
      claiming that Kovtun and Lugovoi were also victims of the incident and that the accusations are politically
      motivated. To this day, all attempts to extradite them from Russia have failed. Dmitry Kovtun died in 2022 of
      Covid-19, but Andrei Lugovoi is still alive and a Member of the State Duma.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      There is also some evidence indicating that there was another attempt at poisoning him during a meeting on the
      16th of October in the boardroom of 25 Grosvenor Street (the office of Tim Reilly). The meeting was attended by
      Lugovoi Kovtun, Litvinenko and Reilly. This attempt was unsuccessful.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article-text">
      The poisoning and its investigation strained the diplomatic relationship between the UK and Russia.
